/**
 * @title   ERC20 Issuance Token with Blacklist Functionality
 *
 * @notice  An ERC20 token implementation that extends ERC20Issuance_v1 with
 *          blacklisting capabilities. This allows accounts with the blacklist
 *          manager role to restrict specific addresses from participating in
 *          token operations.
 *
 * @dev     This contract inherits from:
 *              - IERC20Issuance_Blacklist_v1.
 *              - ERC20Issuance_v1.
 *          Key features:
 *              - Individual address blacklisting.
 *              - Batch blacklisting operations.
 *              - Owner-controlled manager role assignment.
 *              - Blacklist manager controlled blacklist management.
 *              Blacklist operations are performed by accounts with the
 *              blacklist manager role, while the contract owner controls who
 *              can be a blacklist manager.
 *          All blacklist operations can only be performed by accounts with the
 *          blacklist manager role.
